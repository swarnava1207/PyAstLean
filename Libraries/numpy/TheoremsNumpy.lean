# Correctness theorems for the `numpy` runtime surface

Structural guarantees about the NumPy-style helpers: the *shapes* the constructors produce and
the *lengths* the elementwise/reduction helpers preserve. These are the invariants downstream
code silently relies on — `zeros((r, c))` really has `r` rows of `c` columns, `eye(n)` really is
square, `cumsum` keeps the vector length, `diff` drops exactly one element. They double as
machine-checked documentation: a regression that breaks one of these shapes breaks its proof.

Numeric-value identities over `Float` are deliberately omitted: Lean's `Float` is IEEE-754 and
admits no useful algebraic rewriting (no associativity, `NaN ≠ NaN`, etc.).
