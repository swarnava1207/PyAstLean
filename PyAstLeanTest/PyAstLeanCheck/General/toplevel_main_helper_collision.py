# Regression: a user-defined `_main` helper must not collide with the renamed entry point.
# Python's `main()` is renamed to `main'` (not `_main`) when it coexists with a `__main__`
# guard, precisely so the existing `_main` helper is left untouched. Here `_main` stays a
# `private def _main` (its own name), `main` becomes `main'`, the call `main()` inside the
# guard is rewritten to `main'`, and the guard owns Lean's `def main : IO Unit`.
