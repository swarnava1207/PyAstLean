# Bare top-level `for`/`if`/`while` are not executable in Lean, so we thread the names
# each block mutates as state: the block becomes a value returning the updated names,
# which are then re-exported as fresh `def`s. Names assigned once before a block are
# versioned (`x₀`) so the clean name (`x`) holds the block's result, and each result def
# is named after a short position-based hash so distinct blocks never collide.
#
# A standalone `def main()` (with no `__main__` guard) keeps the name `main`, since here
# it is just a normal, importable function rather than the entry point.
