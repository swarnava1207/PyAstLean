/-!
Registry for Python builtins that lower to ordinary Lean runtime names.

Special builtins such as `print` and `input` still need custom call lowering
because they affect evaluation order, effects, or argument interpretation.

/--
Registry for *variadic* builtins that lower by folding one binary runtime function over their
(two-or-more) arguments. This is the general, data-driven home for "n-ary" builtins: a single
generic handler in the call lowering reads this table, so adding such a builtin is one row here
rather than a new branch in the call generator.

`zip(x₁, …, xₙ)` is `pyZip x₁ (pyZip x₂ (… (pyZip xₙ₋₁ xₙ)))` — a *right* fold of the 2-way
`pyZip`. That yields the right-nested n-tuple `(a₁, (a₂, …, aₙ))` that tuple unpacking projects
through, and `pyZip`'s shortest-wins truncation composes to "truncate to the shortest input".
