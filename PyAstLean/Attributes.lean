Registry mapping Python-style method names to their Lean runtime implementations.

The runtime functions themselves live under `PyAstLean/PyAPI/*`; this file keeps the
codegen-facing dispatch table in one place.

Only Python methods belong here. Builtins and operators that lower to CommonProtocols
functions like `pyLen` or `pyContains` should be wired through builtin/operator
lowering instead of this table.

Backward-compatible alias used by older codegen paths.

The `?`-suffixed version is the canonical name because lookup may fail, but keeping
this alias avoids churn in generators that still call `pythonMethodMap`.
